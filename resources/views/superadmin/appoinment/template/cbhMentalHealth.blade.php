            <p>If you believe you will be hospitalized for mental health care in the future and that your doctor may
              think you arenâ€™t able to make good decisions about your treatment, then completing a mental health advance
              directive will ensure that your treatment choices are known. It is important that you decide NOW, what
              types of treatment you do or do not want and to appoint a friend or family member to make the mental
              health care decisions that you want carried out. You may always change your preferences or surrogate
              later. </p>
            <p>You can use the following Advance Directive form to direct your future care.</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Reach each section of the form carefully and talk about your choices with someone you trust.</li>

                professional, an employee of a facility that might provide services to you, an employee of the
                Department of Children and Family Services or a member of the Local Advocacy Council. </li>
              <li> You should sign the form in front two witnesses. </li>
              <li> Make sure your surrogate understands your wishes and is willing to accept the responsibility. Your
                surrogate (and a back-up alternate surrogate if you wish) should sign this form now or at a later time
                to show they are aware you have chosen them to be your surrogate.</li>
              <li> Have copies made and give them to your surrogate, your case manager, your doctor, the hospital or
                crisis unit at which you are most likely to be treated, your family and anyone else who might be
                involved in your care. Discuss your choices with each of them. </li>
